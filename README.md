# Second Semester - Programming I

Tasks from the laboratory: [__Programming I__](https://usosweb.umk.pl/kontroler.php?_action=katalog2/przedmioty/pokazPrzedmiot&kod=1000-I1PR1). 

Tasks come from [ZawodyWeb](https://www.mat.umk.pl:8070/ZawodyWeb) or they are additionally asked by the lecturer. Many tasks come from the [UVa](https://uva.onlinejudge.org) website.

I used the __functional programming__ paradigm and the __ANSI C__ standard with flags: `-wall`, `-pedantic`, `-ansi`.
